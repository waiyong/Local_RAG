No visitors are allowed in the Data Lab without the presence of a Data Lab Administrator. MOM reserves the right to close the Data Lab if no Data Lab Administrators are available. \n\n<Data Security>  \n\nAccess to the Data Lab will be granted for a maximum of one year per instance. The duration can be extended toward the expiry date.\n\nWhen seeking an extension, officers are required to provide an email from their HOD/CDO to endorse the new period of access. Officers are recommended to request for the extension at least 2 weeks before the date they intend to visit the lab.\n\nAgencies/Officers shall inform MOM if officers have left the agencies, changed department or are no longer involved in the project that their Data Lab access were approved for.\n\nPhotography and videography are not allowed in the Data Lab. All personal belongings (eg. writing materials, GSIB, mobile devices) are to be deposited in the lockers located outside of the Data Lab. Writing materials will be provided if required (eg. for noting down of file path) and may be subjected to checks upon exiting the Data Lab.\n\nData accessed in the course of analysis in the Data Lab must not be transmitted out without prior written authorization from MOM.  \n\nOfficers are not to reproduce, in any manner, data accessed from the Data Lab. Officers are to protect and keep information accessed from the data lab confidential in accordance with the requirements laid down by the MOM and by the Official Secrets Act.\n\nIf an officer is found to be in breach of the data security conditions above, MOM reserves the right to deny the officer future access to the Data Lab.\n\nPlease note that MOM Data Lab has high security control over extraction of individual and firm level data.

For publication purpose, please approach our Manpower Research and Statistics Department (MRSD) if MRSD has the required data.\n\nOfficers will be responsible for any misrepresentation of the data. Officers should consult the relevant Policy Owners when in doubt on the contextual interpretation of the data such that misrepresentation of the data is minimised.\n\n</Data Usage/Interpretation>\n\n<Guidelines>\n\nThe MOM Data Lab Access Request Form is to be completed by an authorized officer from the requesting agency. The Chief Data Officer (CDO) or Director-level (or equivalent) should approve the undertaking on behalf of the requesting agency.  \n\nThe MOM Data Lab Access Request Form must be duly completed to facilitate accurate assessment. Incomplete forms and/or inadequate information provided may result in the request being rejected or the processing delayed. MOM will get back to you within one week. If the request for access is approved, we will work with you to find the earliest opportunity for you to access the Data Lab, subject to availability of computer terminals.\n\nAdditional processing time would be required if additional datasets are required to be merged with MOM\u2019s administrative employment data. This may take up to 2 weeks from the time MOM receives the dataset required for merging.\n\nOfficers requesting for access to the Data Lab are expected to have a minimal level of technical expertise in the use of software for data analysis (e.g. Tableau, Stata, Python, R).  \n\nWith effect from 1 Nov 2021, the following file management rules will apply for Data Lab usage: \n\nLarge files (defined as > 1 GB) on the server that have not been modified in the last 12 months will be automatically deleted.  \n\nSmaller files on the server that have not been modified in the last 24 months will be automatically deleted.  \n\nLarge files (e.g. processed datasets) must be stored locally (D: or E: drives) while smaller files (e.g. codes, Tableau workbooks) can be stored on the server. Files stored locally can be transferred between terminals.  \n\nFiles stored on the local drives of Data Lab terminals may be deleted if not accessed within the last 12 months.  \n\nOfficers are reminded to be prudent in their usage and delete obsolete files whenever possible.\n\nThe following guidelines apply for all data extractions: \n\nUnless appropriately justified, officers should consider further aggregation or masking small value counts (e.g. < 5) when extracting aggregated data to minimise re-identification risks. Officers may be required to make another visit if the request for such data is not approved. \n\nAccess rights and file expiry will be implemented for all data extractions, with duration capped at 6 months. Officers may request for extension nearer to expiration date if necessary.  \n\nData files must not be duplicated or shared beyond the approved list of officers. \n\nData files to be extracted should be in the form of Office product types (.xlsx, .docx, .pptx) as far as possible (CSV files are not considered). This is to facilitate implementation of file expiry and access rights controls. \n\nData should be consolidated in 1 single file, with multiple sheets/pages if necessary\n\n</Guidelines>"
